workflows:
  # Below is the definition of your workflow.
  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
  # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
  sample:
    jobs:
      - save_hello_world_output
      - print_output_file:
          requires:
            - save_hello_world_output
      - output_env
      # For running simple node tests, you could optionally use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the job above in fewer lines.
